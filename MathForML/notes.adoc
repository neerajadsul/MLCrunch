= System of Linear Equations

== System of Sentences

* *Non-singular system*: carries as many pieces of information as sentences -> complete system.
* *Singular system*: carries contradictory of redundent information.

== System of Equations

* A system has _finite solutions_ when it is complete and non-singular.
* A system has _infinite solutions_ if not enough information exists, redundent and singular.
* A system has _no-solution_ if information is contradictory, singular system.
